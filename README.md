# Sergio Augusto Angelini
Hello, I'm Sergio.
I'm a master's degree student in Mathematical Engineering at Turin's Politecnico, where my studies focus on the optimization of stochastic processes and networks. 
In this repo you can find most of the code of my personal projects: spacing between Reinforcement Learning, ML, deep learning and classical numerical methods.
