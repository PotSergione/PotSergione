# PotSergione aka Sergio
Hello, I'm Sergio.
I'm a master's degree student at Turin's Politecnico, where my studies focus on the optimization of stochastic processes and networtks. 
In this repo you can find most of the code of my personal projects: spacing between Reinforcement Learning, ML, deep learning and classical methods.
